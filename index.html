        <p>I have been trying to learn web development since 2024. I've watched many tutorials and read many documentation to learn how to build a webpage using HTML and CSS. Thanks Programming Hero to give us this opportunity to learn and grow.</p>

        <div class="reason-paragraph">
            <p>I think development is a cool thing which I like very much. I found it so cool, making a webpage and host it online. It's fun and you can show off your webpage to your friend and GF. I've also impress her by making webpages with her images and audio. I wish her with webpages I built and she was super happy. Long story short, It's a cool thing, to built.</p>

            <p>I once dreamed about going to Google for work as a developer. I dreamed about making cool things using JavaScript. Things that no one ever imagined. But now I don't dream about working on Google. I just want to do something for my Bangladesh.</p>
